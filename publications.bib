	abstract = {The horizontal visibility graph (HVG) representation of a time series is an outerplanar graph whose properties can be used to study the dynamics of nonlinear systems. The HVG approach has seen successful applications from finance and geophysics to cardiology and neuroscience. Recently HVGs have also been extended to applications in image-based pattern recognition. Efficient and scalable online HVG constructions are vital to applying HVG analysis in the context of long or streaming real-world data.

The fastest scalable online method for constructing HVGs, the binary search tree (BST) encoding--decoding algorithm, is $O(n\log n)$. However, in practice BST is highly sensitive to the geometric structure of a time series and its performance degrades significantly when data possess long term dependency or when the sample frequency is high. To avoid these problems we present an ordered rooted tree representation of a time series that is (graph) dual to its HVG and show that the tree can be built in $O(n)$ time. Unlike previous methods, the performance of the dual tree-based algorithm is agnostic with respect to the geometry of the underlying data. Moreover, it allows batchwise progressive updates to HVGs at large scale via an efficient tree merge operation and completely avoids the overheads of graph encoding--decoding needed by the BST algorithm.

We report on experimental benchmarks comparing real-world performance of the dual tree algorithm to other approaches. On data sampled from fractional Brownian motions, deterministic chaotic systems, brain EEG recordings, and the financial markets, the dual tree approach to HVG construction outperforms existing methods, typically by orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce the horizon visibility graph, a simple extension to the popular horizontal visibility graph representation of a time series, and show that it possesses a rigorous mathematical foundation in computational algebraic topology. This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions. The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems, connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent homology.},

	abstract = {Distinguishing between classes of time series sampled from dynamic systems is a common challenge in systems and control engineering, for example in the context of health monitoring, fault detection, and quality control. The challenge is increased when no underlying model of a system is known, measurement noise is present, and long signals need to be interpreted. In this paper we address these issues with a new non parametric classifier based on topological signatures. Our model learns classes as weighted kernel density estimates (KDEs) over persistent homology diagrams and predicts new trajectory labels using Sinkhorn divergences on the space of diagram KDEs to quantify proximity. We show that this approach accurately discriminates between states of chaotic systems that are close in parameter space, and its performance is robust to noise.},
